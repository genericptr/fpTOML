# To unambiguously represent a specific instant in time, you may use an RFC 3339 formatted date-time with offset.

odt1 = 1979-05-27T07:32:00Z
odt2 = 1979-05-27T00:32:00-07:00
odt3 = 1979-05-27T00:32:00.999999-07:00

# For the sake of readability, you may replace the T delimiter between date and time with a space (as permitted by RFC 3339 section 5.6).
