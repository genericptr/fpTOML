# Dotted keys define everything to the left of each dot as a table. Since tables cannot be defined more than once, redefining such tables using a [table] header is not allowed. Likewise, using dotted keys to redefine tables already defined in [table] form is not allowed.

# The [table] form can, however, be used to define sub-tables within tables defined via dotted keys.
