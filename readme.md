# fpTOML Parser

TOML parser for Free Pascal Compiler. Learn more about Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language at https://toml.io/.

```toml
# This is a TOML document.

# TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. 
# TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should be easy to parse into 
# data structures in a wide variety of languages.

### ðŸ‘Œ Features:

 - Fast. Single stream tokenizer and lexer which doesn't use regex.
 - Convert TOML data to TJSONData (see fpJSON in RTL).

### ðŸ›  TODO:

 - Line endings/white space rules are not 100% correct
 - Output TOML data structures as TOML text.
 - Better support for building TOML data programmatically.
